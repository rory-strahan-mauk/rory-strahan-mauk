## to reach me

shoot me a message

## to lend support

practice direct action to support those in need (give all your money to the poor)

## to live without ego

in my life i have recognized in many people (including myself) the desire for attention. over time i understood this to be a negative quality; what does the desire drive one to do? what does one contribute to society by satisfying this desire? to the former, i notice a craving for _credit_, though what is it meant to receive it? all things possible can only be discovered, not created. to be credited implies origin of creation. i believe that to contribute best to society involves action to prevent the idea of self from taking focus. this can be done by embracing the following ideas:

### credit is for records

the idea of "credit" is only useful for keeping records and logs, an individual holds no ownership except for responsibility of initial discovery

### all code is separate from the writer

all written code exists independently of they who write it; as such the writer of code should understand their comprehension of the code they have written to be a phenomenon within the moment of writing, and that this comprehension can be incorrect (a misunderstanding) or lost with time. in this regard any criticism of written code should be seen as the critic's intent to _understand_ and _improve_.

### those who establish their ego cannot be trusted

any contribution to humanity must be seen as independent from the creator (historic actions should not, they qualify as record keeping; creators of destructive force and the use of such forces carry the weight of intent). when someone inserts their image into that which is separate from themselves, it can only be done out of selfishness
